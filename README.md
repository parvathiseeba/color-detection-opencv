# 🎨 Color Detection using OpenCV & K-Means

This project detects dominant colors in an image using
K-Means clustering and OpenCV.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 How It Works
1. Read an image
2. Convert it to RGB format
3. Apply K-Means clustering
4. Extract dominant colors

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python color_detection.py
## 🧠 Note

This project was independently developed by me.
It was inspired by my earlier exposure to computer vision projects,
and this implementation represents my own understanding and learning.
